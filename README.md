# AWS SSM Hybrid Activations Terraform Module üöÄ

This Terraform module facilitates the creation and management of **AWS SSM Hybrid Activations**. With it, you can register and manage on-premises servers, instances in other clouds (like Azure or Google Cloud), and even edge devices as if they were native EC2 instances in AWS.

## What is AWS SSM Hybrid Activations?

**AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Hybrid Activations** is a service that allows you to extend the management of AWS Systems Manager to any machine that is not an EC2 instance. This includes:

*   **On-premises servers:** Manage your physical or virtual servers located in your own data center.
*   **Instances in other clouds:** Monitor and execute commands on VMs from Google Cloud, Azure, etc.
*   **Edge devices (IoT):** Apply configurations and collect inventory from devices in remote locations.

By registering a machine with a hybrid activation, you can use all the features of Systems Manager, such as **Run Command**, **Patch Manager**, **Session Manager**, and **State Manager**, to automate and manage it centrally.

## What does this module do?

This Terraform module automates the creation of an **SSM Hybrid Activation**, which generates an activation code and an ID. This code is used to register your machines with AWS Systems Manager.

In addition, the module also:

*   **Creates an IAM Role:** By default, it provisions the necessary IAM role (`AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`) so that the registered machine has the correct permissions to communicate with the SSM API.
*   **Allows using an existing IAM Role:** If you already have an IAM role, you can simply disable automatic creation and provide the ARN of your role.
*   **Configures limits and expiration:** You can define how many machines can use the activation and when it will expire.

In summary, this module simplifies and standardizes the process of onboarding external machines into the AWS ecosystem.

## Usage üë®‚Äçüíª

```hcl
module "ssm_activation" {
  source = "./aws-ssm-hybrid-activations"

  name               = "my-activation"
  registration_limit = 5
}
```

To use an existing IAM role, set `create_iam_role` to `false` and provide the IAM role ARN:

```hcl
module "ssm_activation" {
  source = "./aws-ssm-hybrid-activations"

  name               = "my-activation"
  iam_role           = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-existing-role"
  create_iam_role    = false
  registration_limit = 5
}
```

## Parameter Explanations üìñ

*   `name`:
    *   **What is it?** It's the name you want to give to the SSM activation.
    *   **Example:** "production-servers-activation".
    *   **Default:** If you don't specify a name, it will be `ssm-activation`.

*   `iam_role`:
    *   **What is it?** It's the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of an existing IAM role that you want to associate with your instances. The IAM role provides the necessary permissions for the instance to communicate with the SSM service.
    *   **When to use?** Use this parameter if you already have a specific role and don't want the module to create a new one. For it to work, you need to set `create_iam_role` to `false`.
    *   **Default:** None (`""`).

*   `registration_limit`:
    *   **What is it?** Defines the maximum number of machines (instances) that can register with SSM using this activation.
    *   **Example:** If you set it to `10`, up to 10 machines can use the same activation code.
    *   **Default:** `1`.

*   `expiration_date`:
    *   **What is it?** The specific date and time when the activation will expire, in RFC3339 format (e.g., `2023-12-31T23:59:59Z`). If this is set, it takes precedence over `expiration_in_days`.
    *   **Default:** `null`. If neither `expiration_date` nor `expiration_in_days` is set, the activation will expire in 24 hours.

*   `expiration_in_days`:
    *   **What is it?** The number of days until the activation expires. This is a simpler way to set the expiration period. The value must be between 1 and 30.
    *   **When is it used?** This is used if `expiration_date` is not set.
    *   **Example:** `15` for 15 days.
    *   **Default:** `null`.

*   `description`:
    *   **What is it?** A brief description for the activation, so you and your team know what it's for.
    *   **Example:** "Activation for the marketing campaign web servers".
    *   **Default:** `SSM Hybrid Activation`.

*   `tags`:
    *   **What is it?** Allows you to add tags to the SSM activation resource. Tags are useful for organizing and controlling costs.
    *   **Example:** `{ "Environment" = "Production", "Team" = "DevOps" }`.
    *   **Default:** None (`{}`).

*   `create_iam_role`:
    *   **What is it?** A boolean value (`true` or `false`) that tells the module whether or not it should create a new IAM role for the activation.
    *   **When to use `false`?** When you already have an IAM role and will specify it in the `iam_role` parameter.
    *   **Default:** `true` (the module creates the role automatically).

*   `default_instance_name`:
    *   **What is it?** The default name that will be given to each instance that registers using this activation.
    *   **How it works:** If you set this variable, its value will be used. If you don't set it, the value of the `name` variable will be used as the default instance name instead.
    *   **Example:** "web-server".
    *   **Default:** `null`.
